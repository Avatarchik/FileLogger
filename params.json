It's best to use with second monitor.\r\n\r\n![Real time logging - LogExpert](http://img.prntscr.com/img?url=http://i.imgur.com/t3WtqFq.png)\r\n\r\nWorks also in Unity Console window.\r\n\r\n![Real time logging - Unity Console](http://img.prntscr.com/img?url=http://i.imgur.com/VmcFIk0.png)\r\n\r\n## Log messages nesting\r\nLogged messages can be nested to reflect their position in the call tree.\r\n\r\n![Nesting](http://img.prntscr.com/img?url=http://i.imgur.com/NjbTEnW.png)\r\n\r\n## Display objects GUID\r\nEach message can have attached an object GUID of the object that called the log method. \r\n\r\nIf you have two calls with identical GUID, you can be sure that they were called from the same object. It's very usefull if you have in the scene more than one instance of the same object.\r\n\r\n![GUID](http://img.prntscr.com/img?url=http://i.imgur.com/pjjIhfe.png)\r\n\r\n## Place message into contex\r\nYou can display additional data related to the log message, like class the log method was called from, and one class before that.\r\n\r\n![Class info](http://img.prntscr.com/img?url=http://i.imgur.com/jVLE6CE.png)\r\n\r\n## Configure what to display in log messages\r\nYou can disable information that you don't need in order to have cleaner view on the logged data.\r\n\r\n[!Inspector options](http://img.prntscr.com/img?url=http://i.imgur.com/1umBYYW.png)\r\n\r\n## Easy filter what and where to log\r\nIf you have many calls to log methods spread all across your project, instead of deleting them, just disable those you don't need.\r\n\r\nYou can also only specify classes or methods that should have logging enabled.\r\n\r\n![Filtering](http://img.prntscr.com/img?url=http://i.imgur.com/uyOtR4Y.png)","google":"UA-62504237-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
